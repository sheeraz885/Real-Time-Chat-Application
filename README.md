 Project Real-Time Chat Application

A real-time chat application is a software system that enables users to communicate with each other instantly through text-based messages over the internet. This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and utilizes Socket.IO for real-time, bi-directional communication between users.

The system allows users to register, log in, manage their profiles, and engage in instant one-to-one messaging. All messages are stored in a MongoDB database, while Socket.IO ensures that new messages are delivered and displayed in real-time without the need to refresh the page.

This application serves as a foundation for more complex messaging platforms and demonstrates the integration of REST APIs with WebSocket-based live communication.
